In Delay = Delay in ms  
LowFreq X = Low frequency Crossover point in Hz  
RT60 = Decay time in seconds  
HF Damping = High frequency damping in Hz  
Wet/Dry Mix = Wetter to the left, drier to the right.  

Plugin defaults to 40ms delay, 250Hz crossover, 2 seconds, 3Khz damping and 50/50 wet/dry mix. This is ready to use as an insert. As a send (with dedicated reverb bus) simply move the wet/dry slider all the way to the left and adjust the channel fader to taste.
